This repo is a mini-project to practice to help learn python programming.
The project is a name generator that generates random names from user inputted text file of names ...

Uses: LongListOfNames.txt (messy, formatted), main.py (functionality), creates CleanListOfNames.txt file.

It finally asks if the user wants the names histogramed by first letter and shows it using matplotlib

1. gets user input: boy or girl name? first letter? max length?
2. reads a file - handle issues, exceptions
3. gets and cleans names-discards non-names
4. sorts (into dict?) the boy names from girl names
5. makes list of applicable names
6. write new file with all cleaned names &
10. returns list of good names
11. histogram with arrow with name

Try to keep  the code clean! :: high level to low level functions, functions do one thing only, exception handling is one function (try thing(), catch error(), finally ONLY), affinitys together, variables close to use (local or nonlocal -> top of function/class). Simple > Complex > Complicated. Use PEP 8 as much as possible.

key words:
-check
get 
-clean
sort
-show
